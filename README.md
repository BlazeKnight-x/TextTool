# TextTool
Run TextTool.py (may need to open folder in Visual Studio).

# Commands
1 - Writes All Names. By Default, the Names are pulled from TextTool/Strings. You need 4 files (all .txt): EnemyName, ItemName, PlaceName, and PSIName.

8 - Dumps All Text to a file (Default Dir: Dumps/AllText.txt). This doesn't dump names.

9 - Writes All Text from Default Dir: TextTool/AllText.txt. This doesn't write names.

# Editables
TextTool/ThingyTable.txt - This is the ThingyTable that the program uses. Make sure to edit it to whatever Table you're using. I recommend using some kind of braces () [] <> to indicate non-single characters.

TextTool/Commands.txt - Don't edit the Hex Codes if you don't know what you're doing (you can edit the Strings tho). These are for named common Commands that the game uses.
